- Typescript is all about Type Safety

What TypeScript does
-- Static Checking
means whenever we are writing the code the parser of the language or syntax is constantly analzyed by the IDE

We write code in TS that code is converted into JS

TS is a evelopment tool
codes still runs in JS

Types in TS
Number,String,Boolean,Null,Undefined,Void,Object,Array,Tuples,etc
Any,Never,unknown,noImplicitAny

any basically means turn of the type checking

let variableName: type = value
